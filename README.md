FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- We need a intermediate layer between the clinet side and microservices 
- Using this middle end , when client sends request we will be able to make decission which microservice shouldd respond yo this request
- We can do message validation , response transformation ,rate limiting 
- We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end .
